The Sentiment Analysis is a NLP/ML project that classifies 10,000 tweets into 27 emotional categories. Several approaches and their performances like Logistic Regression, Bayes Classifiers, Neural Networks, Boosting and Ensemble Methods have been tested on this dataset The objective was to perform better than a baseline model of accuracy 75%, which was acheived successfully by tuning three separate algorithms- Deep Neural network with sigmoid activations, Logistic Regression function, and Support Vector Machine. The parameters of selected algorthims can be found here
